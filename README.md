Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze the dynamic behavior of a landing gear system during touchdown. Specifically, the simulation determines the reaction forces generated by the ground contact.

Key components of the project:
  - System Modeling: The landing gear was modeled according to the specified kinematics and mechanical constraints.
  - Parameter Selection: Suitable parameters for the system, such as stiffness, damping, and geometrical dimensions, were identified to ensure realistic behavior.
  - Dynamic Simulation: A time integration of the system dynamics was performed to capture the evolution of forces during landing.

Ground Contact Modeling
To realistically simulate the wheel-ground interaction:
  - A soft contact model was implemented, allowing for compliant deformation during impact.
  - The contact is moving, reflecting the fact that the plane is landing. In the simulation, this is equivalent to the ground “rising” toward the wheel, producing dynamic reaction forces consistent with actual landing conditions.

Results
The simulation provides:
  - Time history of reaction forces on the landing gear
  - Insights into the dynamic response of the system under landing conditions
  - A foundation for further optimization or structural analysis of landing gear components
